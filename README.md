# TriviaGame

Overview:
I created a trivia game that generates 10 quesitons and answers in a random order, using JavaScript and jQuery logic. Each question has a count down timer, and also tells the user if they chose the correct answer with a gif. After the user has gotten through all 10 questions, they will be showed their collective score, and asked if they want to play again without refreshing the page.
